# CS230 Module 8 Journal

* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Before finding us, The Gaming Room had a successful game, Draw It or Lose It, available only on Android devices. They were seeking to expand upon the current 
game and create a web-based version of Draw It or Lose It, playable on every browser on every platform. Draw It or Lose It is a team-based game where each team 
takes guesses as to what is being drawn and points are awarded for correct answers. 

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I did a good job in researching and documenting the pros and cons of each different platform and tool to be used in the development of the application.
Also, in the final recommendations to the client of what systems and tools to use for this application.

* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a design document on hand when developing code helps a great deal to keep things organized and to keep me focused. Working through the design document
allowed me to fully understand the requirements and scope of the project, and provided a point of reference when developing the actual code. 
Without a design document, one is left to simply relying on written emails or notes from face-to-face meetings to develop the code.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise any part of the document, I would choose to revise the Design Constraints section. I feel like I could have gone more in depth with the 
actual constraints. I could have added constraints for the need for a database, and cloud-based services. Also, I could have added constraints about 
server security, as that was a big concern for The Gaming Room.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by reading the requirements in the assignment rubric. In my opinion, the best way to define the user's needs is to host a 
focus group of some sort, and talk face-to-face about their needs and expectations. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs when designing
because the user is the client, and they will be using the software more than anyone else. If the user's needs are not correctly met and their expectations
not met or exceeded, there was no reason to even develop the software in the first place. Design documents allow a developer to formally convey exactly
how they interpret the user's needs to the company that is developing the software. Ideally, the user or client would be able to read and "sign off" on
this document as well.

* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I have always tried to approach designing software with thouroughness, but I have never written a design document before. In the past, I would try to understand the
user's needs and expectations as much as possible through email corresponence or face-to-face meetings. I would then make a quick prioritized list of requirements
as I understood them and start implementing them as best I could. In the future, I would be thrilled to use a design document to map out the user's needs
and requirements of the software. I would try to host a focus group with the client to really nail down what they expect from the software, and then I would
start writing a design document. I would update the document any time the requirements changed, and I would want the client to be involved in my process as much as
possible. I think transparency with the client goes a long way in making sure there are no surprises during the process and for clarity throughout the development.
